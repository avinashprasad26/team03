Contribution of Team Members  :-

Each members of this team have given their efforts for finding the efficent output for this assignment program.
Basically,
	   AVINASH PRASAD tells the best way to create a Tree Node and gives the concept for traversing the Huffman 
Tree and store the Huffman Codes in a map. And also gives the concept for decoding of the encoded string.
	   DHRUV SHUKLA have given the concept of priority queue to store the live nodes in the huffman trees and tell
us how to use in the code.
	   KARTHIK K gives us the concept of prefix rule which result in uniquely decodable code and also helped in 
debugging of the program.

INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM  :-

ACTUALLY WE USED THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS IN OUR PROGRAM. AND BY THE HELP OF THIS WE CAN RUN OUR PROGRAM IN THE CMD
JUST BY TYPING THE FILENAME AND INPUT SEPARATED BY SPACE.
					
				EG:-  filename        			input
				      Asn03G03P05   "AVINASH PRASAD DHRUV JYOTI SHUKLA KARTHIK K" 

NOTE :- THE INPUT SHOULD BE IN " " QUOTES. IT READ AS A WHOLE STRING.

Details on example invocation and output :-

FOR EXAMPLE,FOR NAMES : "computer science and engineering" 

OUTPUT :-

	C:\1KS18CS008\Assignment1\src>javac Asn03G03P05.java

	C:\1KS18CS008\Assignment1\src>java Asn03G03P05 "computer science and engineering"
	Huffman Codes are :

	  1111
	a 10000
	c 010
	d 10100
	e 00
	g 0111
	i 1110
	m 10101
	n 110
	o 01100
	p 01101
	r 1011
	s 10010
	t 10011
	u 10001

	Original string was :
	computer science and engineering

	Encoded string is :
	01001100101010110110001100110010111111100100101110001100100011111000011010100111100110011111101100000101111101100111

	Decoded string is:
	computer science and engineering

CHALLENGES FACED :-

	INITIALLY ,OUR PROGRAM WAS SHOWING MANY ERRORS AND VERY DIFFICULT IN TRAVERSING THE HUFFMAN AND STORING HUFFMAN
CODES IN A MAP. AND ALSO GETTING PROBLEM IN STORING THE LIVE NODES IN PRIORITY QUEUE. BUT LATER BY OUR CONTINUOUS EFFORTS
WE MANAGE TO FIND THE SOLUTION AND TAKES SOME HELP FROM THE YOUTUBES VIDEOS ON THE TOPIC PRIORITY QUEUE.THE URL OF THE
VIDEO : (https://youtu.be/LDZc3Bph1vw).
	
	FINALLY, BY THE HARD WORK OF OUR TEAM HELPED US TO GET THE OUTPUT IN EFFICIENT MANNER.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Things we learnt from our assignment :-

	THIS PROGRAM HELPED US TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND FILE COMPRESSION. WE LEARNT THE CONCEPT ABOUT PREFIX
	RULE, UNIQUELY DECODABLE CODE AND CONSTRUCTION OF HUFFMAN TREE. AND MOST IMPORTANT WE LEARN THE CONCEPT OF PRIORITY
	QUEUE AND HUFFMAN CODING.
